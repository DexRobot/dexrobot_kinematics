Examples
=======

This section demonstrates how to use the DexRobot Kinematics library with complete example scripts.

Hardware control using finger inverse kinematics
---------------

In this example, we solve inverse kinematics for a finger, and send the resulting joint angles to DexHand using the `pyzlg_dexhand` library.

Interfacing inverse kinematics with ROS
---------------

In this example, we solve inverse kinematics for a finger, and publish the resulting joint angles to a ROS topic. The script can be used in combination with ROS nodes in `pyzlg_dexhand` or `dexrobot_mujoco` to control either hardware or simulated hand.

Forward kinematics based on hardware feedback
---------------

In this example, we read joint angles from DexHand using the `pyzlg_dexhand` library, and compute the forward kinematics to get the fingerpad and fingertip poses.
