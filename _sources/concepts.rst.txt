Concepts
=======

This section explains the key concepts and conventions used in the DexRobot Kinematics library.

Coordinate Systems and Frames
---------------------------

The library uses two primary reference frames:

1. **Hand Frame**: Local coordinate system centered at the hand base.

   - Origin at the hand base/wrist
   - X-axis pointing toward palm
   - Y-axis pointing away from thumb for left hand, toward thumb for right hand
   - Z-axis pointing toward fingertips

   .. image:: ../assets/hand_frame.png
      :alt: Hand Frame
      :align: center

2. **World Frame**: Global coordinate system. When using a hand in isolation:

   - The hand frame aligns with the world frame unless a base_pose is specified
   - With a base_pose, all computations transform between these frames

.. code-block:: text

    ┌─────────┐  base_pose   ┌──────────┐
    │ World   │ ───────────> │ Hand     │
    │ Frame   │ <─────────── │ Frame    │
    └─────────┘              └──────────┘


The hand can be placed anywhere in the world frame by specifying a base_pose:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import pinocchio as pin
   from dexrobot_kinematics.utils.types import Position, Pose

   # Create rotation matrix (90 degrees around Y axis)
   R = pin.utils.rpyToMatrix(0, np.pi/2, 0)

   # Create translation vector (1 meter in X direction)
   t = np.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0])

   # Define base pose
   base_pose = Pose(position=Position.from_array(t), orientation=R)

   # Use in forward kinematics
   poses = hand.forward_kinematics(joint_angles, base_pose=base_pose, frame="world")

The same base_pose can be used in inverse kinematics to transform target positions from the world frame to the hand frame.

End Effector Types
----------------

The library supports two types of end effectors:

1. **Fingerpads**: The contact surfaces on each finger, used for grasping objects (green markers in the image below).
2. **Fingertips**: The very ends of each finger (red markers in the image below).

.. image:: ../assets/end_effectors.png
   :alt: End Effectors
   :align: center


You can specify which end effector type to use in both forward and inverse kinematics:

.. code-block:: python

   # Get fingerpad poses
   fingerpad_poses = hand.forward_kinematics(joint_angles, end_effector="fingerpad")

   # Get fingertip poses
   fingertip_poses = hand.forward_kinematics(joint_angles, end_effector="fingertip")

Inverse Kinematics Principles
--------------------------

The IK solver uses a damped least-squares method (Levenberg-Marquardt) to iteratively solve for joint angles:

1. **Objective**: Find joint angles that place end effector(s) at target position(s)
2. **Method**:
   - Start with initial guess for joint angles
   - Compute current end effector position
   - Calculate error vector (difference between current and target position)
   - Compute Jacobian matrix (relates joint velocities to end effector velocities)
   - Update joint angles using damped least-squares formula
   - Repeat until convergence or maximum iterations

The solver handles constraints including:
- Joint limits
- Joint coupling between PIP and DIP joints, consistent with the hand's mechanical design
